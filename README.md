# Pymaceuticals Analysis
## Overview
The data from Pymaceuticals contains the results of 9 drug trials across 248 lab mice. 
Note: All data was dropped for Mouse g989 due to duplicate timepoints and varied Tumor measurements. 
## Drug Regimen Assumptions
We were asked to look into the four most promising drug regimens; Infubinoal, Ceftamin, Ramicane, and Capomulin. 
- When comparing the results of Infubinol and Ceftamin regimens to the placebo, neither regimen appeared to have a significant effect in decreasing the tumor volume in the mice.
- The outlier in the Infubinol trial does not appear to be significant. Upon further investigation, we find that data was only collected on the mouse twice.
- For this small trial, it seems that Ramicane is the most promising regimen, followed closely by Capomulin. Both regimens show positive outcomes when compared to the placebo. Their low variance also implies that they perform more consistently than any of the other regimens tested.  
# Tumor Growth Assumptions
- There appears to be a positive correlation between the weight of the mice and the volume of the tumor. This could help predict tumor volume in future testing.
