## Pymaceuticals Analysis
# Overview
The data from Pymaceuticals contains the results of 9 drug trials across 248 lab mice. 
Note: All data was dropped for Mouse g989 due to duplicate timpoints and varied Tumor measurements. 
# Drug Regimen Assumptions
We were asked to look into the four most promising drug regimens, Infubinoal, Ceftamin, Ramicane, and Capomulin. 
- When comparing the results of the Infubinol and Ceftamin regimens to the placebo, neither regimen appears to have a significant effect on decreasing the tumor volume during the trial window. 
- The outlier in the Infubinol trial does not appear to be significant. Upon further investigation, we find that this mouse had very few datapoints. 
- For this small trial, it seems that Ramicane appears to be the most promising regimine. It appreared to be the most consistant of the four focus drugs based on it's low variance and standard deviation. 
# Tumor Growth Assumptions
- There appears to be a positive correltion
